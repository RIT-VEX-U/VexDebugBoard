# _V5 Debug Board_

This is the main software repository for the V5 Debug Board: a board designed to slot into the VEX V5 Smart Port, and transmit debug data over a websocket to a laptop. The data is received by a [Foxglove application](https://foxglove.dev) instance, and allows for:
- 3D visualization of Odometry
- Real-time graphing for robot tuning
- Wireless print statements
